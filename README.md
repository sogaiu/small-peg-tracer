# small-peg-tracer (spt)

Generate and investigate traces for Janet PEG execution [1].

The generated traces are static HTML files that should be viewable and
navigable in typical web browsers.

Some remarks about [when](doc/when.md) one might use this.

## Installation

Quick:

```
jpm install https://github.com/sogaiu/small-peg-tracer
```

Manual:

```
git clone https://github.com/sogaiu/small-peg-tracer
cd small-peg-tracer
jpm install
```

In either case, success should lead to the command `spt` being
available on `PATH` and a `spt` directory within a directory on
`JANET_PATH`.

## Usage Patterns

`spt` can be used to generate sample traces from existing samples or
user-specified calls to `peg/match` / `meg/match`.

### Just Generate Some Trace

With no other arguments, some trace files will be generated based on
how `janet` is feeling:

```
$ spt
Selected file: <dir-on-JANET_PATH>/spt/trace/samples/backmatch-sequence-capture-string.janet
Generated trace files in /tmp/spt-trace-458.
Recommended starting points:
* first event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-458/first.html
* last event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-458/last.html
* event log: file:///tmp/spt-trace-458/log.html
```

The invocation's output should contain some potentially useful
starting point URLs.  Using a web browser to interact with the
generated files is recommended.  If the browser supports JavaScript,
some shortcut keys may be available.

### Make a Trace from Bundled Sample File

With at least one argument that is not a file path or file name, an
attempt will be made to filter for and select from existing samples
whose names (typically built from PEG special names) contain the
supplied argument:

```
$ spt sequence
Selected file: <dir-on-JANET_PATH>/spt/trace/samples/sequence-string.janet
Generated trace files in /tmp/spt-trace-900.
Recommended starting points:
* first event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-900/first.html
* last event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-900/last.html
* event log: file:///tmp/spt-trace-900/log.html
```

### Make a Trace from a User-Constructed Sample File

`spt` can also be passed a file path or file name containing suitable
text from which to construct a call to `meg/match`:

```
$ spt <dir-on-JANET_PATH>/spt/trace/samples/pyrmont-inqk.janet
Selected file: <dir-on-JANET_PATH>/spt/trace/samples/pyrmont-inqk.janet
Generated trace files in /tmp/spt-trace-e75.
Recommended starting points:
* first event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-e75/first.html
* last event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-e75/last.html
* event log: file:///tmp/spt-trace-e75/log.html
```

Here is what a typical file looks like:

```janet
[~{:main (* :tagged -1)
   :tagged (unref (replace (* :open-tag :value :close-tag) ,struct))
   :open-tag (* (constant :tag) "<" (capture :w+ :tag-name) ">")
   :value (* (constant :value) (group (any (+ :tagged :untagged))))
   :close-tag (drop (* "</" (cmt (* (backref :tag-name) (capture :w+)) ,=) ">"))
   :untagged (capture (some (if-not "<" 1)))}
 "<p><em>Hello</em> <strong>world</strong>!</p>"]
```

Basically the content consists of a tuple of the arguments to pass to
`peg/match` / `meg/match`.

To see some other sample files, see the `spt/trace/samples` directory
that may be living on `JANET_PATH` (for a non-project-local
installation).

### Make a Trace Based on Standard Input Content

`spt -s` can be usefully invoked from an editor, being passed a
suitable selection of text via standard input.  The selection should
be a self-contained call [2] to `peg/match`.

```
$ echo '(peg/match ~(capture "a") "a")' | spt -s
Generated trace files in /tmp/spt-trace-87a.
Recommended starting points:
* first event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-87a/first.html
* last event: file:///tmp/spt-trace-87a/last.html
* event log: file:///tmp/spt-trace-87a/log.html
```

Note that there are numerous self-contained calls to `peg/match` in
most of the files in the `spt/margaret/examples` directory.

#### Emacs

In Emacs, this might be done by first invoking:

```
M-x shell-command-on-region
```

Then at the minibuffer prompt of:

```
Shell command on region:
```

fill in as:

```
Shell command on region: spt -s
```

followed by pressing the enter key.

#### Vim / Neovim

In Vim / Neovim, using visual mode to make a selection and then typing
`:` to invoke command line mode should show:

```
:'<,'>
```

Subsequently, typing `:w !spt -t` to make that:

```
:'<,'>:w !spt -s
```

...and then pressing the enter key should hopefully do the trick.

## Notes

The generated files are not cleaned up automatically by `spt`.  The
operating system might clean them up at some point, but otherwise the
output URLs should give an idea of which directories to delete.

## Usage Summary

```
$ spt -h

  Usage: spt [file|pattern] ...

  Generate and inspect Janet PEG execution traces [1].

    -h, --help                   show this output

    -s, --stdin                  read stdin for input

    -d, --dark                   use dark theme
    -l, --light                  use light theme

  Generate trace files for `meg/match` using arguments
  contained in `file` or a file selected by
  substring-matching a file name specified by `pattern`.
  `file` should be a `.janet` file, which when evaluated,
  returns a tuple with values for each desired argument.
  If `file` or `pattern` is not provided, some appropriate
  content will be arranged for.  Generated files will end
  up in a subdirectory.  `meg/match`'s signature is the
  same as that of `peg/match`.

  With the `-s` / `--stdin` option, standard input is
  read for text representing a call to `peg/match` or
  `meg/match`.

  With the `-l` / `--light` option, render using a light
  theme.  If the `-d` / `--dark` option is chosen,
  render using a dark theme.  If none of these options
  is specified, default to rendering using the dark theme.

  [1] Traces are generated using `meg/match`, a pure-Janet
  implementation of Janet's `peg/match`.  See the
  `margaret` Janet module for more details.

## Footnotes

[1] `spt` uses `meg/match` (provided by
[margaret](https://github.com/sogaiu/margaret)), which is an emulation
of Janet's `peg/match`.  There are some differences, but hopefully
this tool will still be useful enough (^^;

[2] The phrase "self-contained call" above means the call could be
handed to janet directly for evaluation without having previously
arranged for any bindings.  For example:

```janet
(peg/match ~(capture "a") "a")
```

would be "self-contained", while the call to `peg/match` below:

```janet
(def text "hello")

(peg/match ~(capture "a") text)
```

would not be "self-contained" because a binding for `text` would
need to have been arranged for before the `peg/match` call.
